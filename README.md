# Pax the RP2040 Devboard
Hello, my name is Voidless, and this is my first ever devboard using the RP2040 microcontroller. 

I made this project as part of the Blueprint YSWS for the Hack Club organization. I followed a guide on how to make a RP2040 Devboard using the KiCad PCB-making software. I wanted to learn more about electronics, and this project taught me about data flow, capacitors, resistors, and a whole bunch of electronics concepts.
